# Library

An archival repository of all my public writings, blogs, slides, etc etc etc. After writing [Code as Generational Wealth](/newsletter-good-graphics/2021-07-17-code-as-generational-wealth-archived-2021-09-06.pdf) I began to rexamine my past publishing experiments. This is an attempt at documenting a body of work that is illegible at a glance but in agregate reveals coherence.

### Filename Convention

Most filenames contain a slug and dates of publish and archival. The desired convention is:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-$slug-archived-YYYY-MM-DD

example: 2021-03-14-hello-world-archived-2021-09-10
```
